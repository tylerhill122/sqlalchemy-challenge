In this repository we were asked to analyze climate data from Hololulu, Hawaii to prepare for a hypothetical vacation to the area.

### Part 1: Climate Analysis and Exploration

For this section we will use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. Methods used include: SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Part 2: Design Your Climate App

For this section we are tasked with creating an app in Flask that will act as an API displaying the results of our previously-created queries.
